 *          **User guide**
 *          The BLM will start in mode 1 (DCS-BIOS) mode by default. This means you should
 *          see only dark panels. By pressing the rotary encoder, you can switch to mode 2
 *          (manual mode) and see manually dimmable backlights in green. Pressing again, 
 *          you should see a rainbow pattern. Pressing again, you get back to mode 1.
 *
 *
 *          **Configuration guide**
 *          (1) If you are building according to spec:
 *              ...you only need to work with this file (the main .ino). Generally, the 
 *              code in works as follows: at power up, three kinds of objects 
 *              are created: one Board() object -the top-level object - that 
 *              represents the BLM board itself. Ten Channel() objects, each of which 
 *              represent on of the ten BL channels. And many Panel() objects, each of 
 *              which represents a specific panel in the pit.
 *              The board object handles the change between the three modes (normal, 
 *              manual, rainbow) that you can invoke with the rotary encoder. It also 
 *              handles the brightness control for the normal mode. Therefore, 
 *              it is the interface to the user.
 *              Each channel object handles one LED strip and FastLED commands. Therefore, 
 *              they are the interface to the hardware.
 *              The panel objects represent cockpit panels and 'know' which of their LED
 *              has which role (e.g. backlighting or specific indicators such as "FIRE").
 *              They also handle DCS-Bios commands. Therefore, they are the interface to 
 *              DCS-BIOS.
 *              In the setup() function, add only those panels that you are using. When 
 *              adding, adjust the panel order according to your physical connections. 
 *              Comment out the panels that you do not have connected. You do not need to 
 *              adapt any LED indices or LED counts, or other files, anywhere. Also make 
 *              sure that the pins defined below match your physical wiring.
 *          (2) If you add panels in a non-standard order: 
 *              Adapt the panel order in the setup() function as described in (1). If you
 *              intend to add more panels to a channel than the default, make sure that you
 *              increase the LED count of the affected channel (e.g. LIP_1_LED_COUNT) in 
 *              the "Define pinouts and channels" section appropriately.
 *          (3) If you want to change the colors: 
 *              Open the Colors.h file and change the color definitions. Observe that in
 *              this file, the colours according to MIL-STD-3099 are documented. However,
 *              these may not fit exactly to the visual output that your LEDs provide. 
 *              Therefore, adapt colors as needed for your build and LEDs in use.
 *              Note: LEDs dimming uses FastLED's nscale8_video() function. It provides a
 *              more color-preserving dimming effect than pure RGB value recalculation.
 *          (4) If you have an non-standard wiring / pinout of your backlight controller:
 *              Adapt the pinout in the "Define pinouts and channels" section in this file.
 *          (5) If you are using custom panels: 
 *              Adapt or create a new panel class in the "panels" folder. You may use the 
 *              1A2A1_MASTER_ARM.h as template. Make sure to follow its structure closely.
 * 
 *          **Troubleshooting**
 *          (!) If the panels stay dark:
 *              First confirm the correct wiring of the rotary  encoder. Second, observe
 *              if the onboard LED is blinking fast. If so, this means that the power-on
 *              self-test has detected an exceedance of  panels added to a channel. In 
 *              this case, you need to increase the LED count of the affected channel in 
 *              the "Define pinouts and channels" section.
 *              If the onboard LED is not blinking, the code failed to initialize and 
 *              start up properly. Revert the last changes.
 *          (!) If the BLM does not react after a while of operation: 
 *              I observed that a faulty LED on a panel can cause the BLM to stop working 
 *              after a few mins of operation. The faulty LED is usually the first LED on 
 *              a channel that stays dark. Replacing the faulty LED should fix the issue.
 * 
 *          **Technical Background**
 *          This sketch addresses the following functional OH requirements:
 *          1. Enable control of OH backlights and indicators with DCS-BIOS.
 *          2. Enable control of OH backlights manually, if DCS-BIOS is not available.
 *          3. Enable test of all backlights and indicators with a rainbow pattern.
 *          4. Backlights and indicators share the same LED strip.
 *          5. Different users may build a different subset of panels and connect them 
 *             in varying orders as their build progresses; the code must be modular
 *             enough to allow this. 
 *          6. As the users' build progresses, and more panels are added, the user shall 
 *             not need to recalculate LED indices/counts. She/he shall not need to 
 *             reprogram this BL controller (if build to spec)
 *          7. Code execution must be fast to avoid LED flickering (output side) or loss 
 *              of updates coming from DCS-BIOS (input side).
 *          8. Extensible for a future use of the PREFLT function (feasibility TBD)
 *          This sketch respects the following technical  limitations:
 *          A. DCS-BIOS callbacks expect 'static' functions; dynamic alloc not allowed.
 *          B. Arduino MEGA 2560 has 8KB of SRAM.
 *          C. FastLED.show() command is time-sensitive 
 *          Solutions:
 *          - An OOP programming paradigm is used, as functionalities repeat across panels
 *          - The generic Panel class (Panel.h) is the base class for all panels 
 *            Each panel must be inherit from it.
 *          - For each panel in the pit, one panel class exists in the panel folder.
 *          - These panels classes encapsulate all there is to know (LED roles, DCS-BIOS
 *            methods) about the panel in one spot. In particular, they:
 *            (1) inherit the common behaviour from the generic Panel class;
 *            (2) contain a table with LED indices (panel-local) and their roles;
 *            (3) provide a method to recalculate panel-local indices to strip indices;
 *            (4) additionally implement DCS-BIOS callbacks unique to this panel;
 *            (5) are singletons for compatibility with DCS-BIOS callbacks (rqrmt 5, 6)
 *          - Channels class implements logical LED strip mgmt (rqrmt 4, 7)
 *          - Board class implements mode change logic and mode control (= steer what 
 *            happens during a loop of the Arduino) (rqrmt 1, 2, 3)
 *          - LedUpdateState class implements central point for LED update calls,
 *            ensuring high performance (rqrmt 6)
 *          - LedStruct class prepares LedText struct for future PREFLT function (rqrmt 8)
